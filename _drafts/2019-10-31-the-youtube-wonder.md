YouTube is just plain impressive. Launched in 2005, fourteen years later 300
hours of video are uploaded every minute. It generates more than 4B$ of
revenues annually. There are over 1 billion video views on mobile devices
alone, every single day. This thing is an absolute beast. 

But as everyone with a kid would know, it is also a gigantic cesspool. Leave
your 5 year old for 3 minutes unattended behind YouTube and she will be
watching Ryans World or worse yet one of those candy unwrap videos, every
single time. The amount of—and please pardon my French—crap on YouTube is
astounding. The signal versus noise on that platform is through the floor, very
much unlike something like Wikipedia. On both of these you can loose hours and
hours by jumping from one to the other page or video. The difference is that on
Wikipedia sometimes you end up on a decent article thats just not so
interesting to you. On YouTube you end up on total garbage.

But because YouTube is so gigantic, there are absolute jewels of content to be
found in that pile. YouTube democratized the production, distribution and
viewing of these videos, lowering the barrier to entry enormously. This leads
to content that is razor focussed: take any niche topic and go super deep. In a
national TV broadcast situation how many channels are devoted to people
building a Scanning Electron Microscope from scratch? You pick the nation, the
answer is still going to zero. But on YouTube you will [find a non-zero
answer](https://youtu.be/VdjYVF4a6iU).

So the challenge then becomes one of discovery. Lots has been written about the
(in)famous YouTube algorithm—I kid, of course more videos have been produced
about that topic than written posts. I realized I curated a list of ±150
channels that I admire, the jewels in that massive heap of candy-unwrap-videos.
And I wanted to share some of those for discovery, hopefully someone finds
these useful. (I do realize the number of people liking this exact set of
videos is exactly one: me.)

The subscriber counts for each channel were taken November 2019.

## Watches
### Hodinkee (126k)
The one and only content side for watch collectors. It is not a small setup as
itemploys 88 people but some of the content is excellent. Here, for example, is
a video that [goes through all the different references for the OMEGA
Speedmaster](https://youtu.be/w8-DdurbLKw). Or here is their [Talking Watches
episode with Alton Brown](https://youtu.be/PvWiUYKgb6M). First time I saw these
I was star struck mashing up the Speedmaster and Alton.

### Watchfinder & Co (391k)
This channel is impressive because it showcases a massive mount of expertise on
display, but those delicious finger licking production values are through the
roof. Here is an example where a [Patek is being compared to a
Speedmaster](https://youtu.be/ZT9rvtlk_yc); those close ups and lighting a
fantastic. Similarly here is their [deep dive into
Chronographs](https://youtu.be/k1HhRPDmCgw).

## Video editing
### Aidin Robbins (126k)
It is beautiful to follow Aidin’s growth through his recording and editing of
movies. The work that he has published is fantastic. The best for me are his
“cinematic sequences” such as his [2018 video](https://youtu.be/b9GtkyN-S1M) or
his [Iceland video](https://youtu.be/WSLbCs64MLc). His tutorials are well put
together. His demeanor and authenticity are notable.  And he often follows up
later with a “how did I make that video” like [this one about the NYC
video](https://youtu.be/GaG9n_acKic).

### Andreas Hem (208k)
Andreas, in my mind, is similar as Aidin: shooting and editing skills are
through the roof. But where Aidin’s work is subtle, Andreas’ work shouts and
goes over the top in the most incredible ways. Here is [Andreas turning himself
into Spiderman](https://youtu.be/xc_uUUY0ngU) or his [100k subscriber
celebration video](https://youtu.be/FmaAlIAMe8I). If that turns out not to be
“over the top” enough for you, then see his [we raided Area 51
video](https://youtu.be/6hnHWDxYm2c).

### DSLR Video Shooter (415k)
Caleb Pike reviews gear for shooting video, including lighting, lenses, [camera
systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLDSa83hU-bIFIowvOfAe2h_C6akKcqRZ).
Straight to the point, honest reviews. This also includes super in-depth
reviews of the Sony and Panasonic cameras. His [color correction and grading
tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLDSa83hU-bKZeB0CCZyHcf3kbcMRKkuK)
are fantastic as well. Unlike some others that play it by feeling, Caleb works
it up from ground principles. He has done a lot of work on audio as well. And
then I have not even spoken about his b-roll!

### JayAreTV (45k)
Jay has done a fantastic job bringing Davinci Resolve knowledge to the
community. Ranging from a simple [Basic callout with
tracking](https://youtu.be/DjdYQCdmYdo) through [Glitchy
Goodness](https://youtu.be/p_H8_iNcRsM) all the way to [building an odometer
from the ground up](https://youtu.be/3jMkUlet4hE) in Fusion.

### Peter McKinnon (4M)
Peter has build up a massive channel with over 4 million subscribers. Combines
talking about methods, the enthusiasm, a little gear reviews and a lot of
personality. Inspiring movies such as [The Bucket
Shot](https://youtu.be/r25IWquxe9s) or [The mountains won’t remember
me](https://youtu.be/2Z0lv6qlj0Q), or [this vlog about
B-roll](https://youtu.be/TXzLvYN-HSc) from a few years ago.

### Taran van Hemert (140k)
Taran works at the massive outfit Linus Tech Tips as an editor. As a geek with
a passion for editing he published some [monumental editing tutorials such as
this one](https://youtu.be/O6ERELse_QY). It apparently took 10 months to edit
this 4 hour beast. Similarly, but on just tad smaller scale, [this comparison
on upscaling algorithms for video](https://youtu.be/MVPrFU6_SEA). Or take [this
40 minute video documenting him building a
treehouse](https://youtu.be/I2G6S33w7As).

### Every Frame a Painting (1.6M)
Every Frame a Painting stopped publishing in 2016, but until that time it did a
fantastic job in dissecting the editing in various movies. For me personally
this almost singlehandedly triggered my interest in editing. If I had to single
out one upload it would be [How does an Editor Think and
Feel](https://youtu.be/3Q3eITC01Fg), but it would be just as easy to pick out
[Composing Movement](https://youtu.be/doaQC-S8de8), [David
Fincher](https://youtu.be/QPAloq5MCUA), [Mother](https://youtu.be/dUOdQxQkVt8)
or [Edgar Wright](https://youtu.be/3FOzD4Sfgag). Loved seeing what he did about
the [Marvel universe and ‘temporary music’](https://youtu.be/7vfqkvwW2fs) as
well. I find it beautiful that YouTube has provided this platform where someone
like this is able to go deep and share these insights. 

### This Guy Edits (268k)
After Every Frame a Painting stopped publishing I went on looking for someone
else dissecting editing, and that quickly became This Guy Edits. Analyzing the
editing in various movies, such as [The 7 Laws of Film
Editing](https://youtu.be/i9mGSDluh9g), [Whiplash’s Brilliant
Editing](https://youtu.be/3qYB1qLx4R8) or this one on [of a scene
analysis](https://youtu.be/T-1VnWU-z5s).

### Film Riot (1.5M)
Film Riot is both a little more commercial and geared towards short films, but
it is still very interesting and very well produced. Here is [Matti Haapoja
going behind the scenes, for example](https://youtu.be/OGtdUBXVL6M). Going back
8 years ago ([example](https://youtu.be/rSo_bMFT5YI)), there is a huge store of
how to story tell, tutorials on [editing](https://youtu.be/9_KOfYrxcF4), [more
editing](https://youtu.be/3sCIiIca6Cc), how to
[film/shoot](https://youtu.be/GZztR8cS3kI), [tips and
tricks](https://youtu.be/91sbBfTIHkc), interact with talent as well as [short
movies](https://youtu.be/EHlxqe2HRRk) that they produced.


## Cycling
### DC Rainmaker (141k)
DC Rainmaker is sitting right on the intersection of good enough video
production quality, cycling, [smart trainers](https://youtu.be/R8Di25Rs4pg),
[power meters](https://youtu.be/Ou_PnOfKDkU), gear reviews and
[GoPro](https://youtu.be/nRMadmQsuY8)/[Drones](https://youtu.be/QQa7BvkXfgk).
Over the years he’s build up so much credibility in this particular niche that
I basically consider it the last word in these matters.

### The Vegan Cyclist (107k)
On the opposite end of the spectrum from DC Rainmaker is The Vegan Cyclist — no
gear reviews but mostly focused on first person perspective of cycling races,
[criteriums](https://youtu.be/SFq7yBrx2Gk) and [tips and
tricks](https://youtu.be/NiLp0UEon98). It’s beautiful to see the ebb and flow
of [success and failure](https://youtu.be/luU4pL8-Nd0), the perseverance and
pain it takes to compete.

## Skiing
### Deb Armstrong (8k)
If you are wondering about how much value someone can generate  in videos by
taking their absolute expertise (in this case a world class skier turned into
gifted coach) and combine it with someone with a camera: look no further than
Deb. Complete no nonsense coaching as well as no nonsense video’s: all straight
to the point. The passion for the kids and the sport flows right off your
screen. After a couple of these videos you are left wishing she is coaching
**your kids**.

### Fantastisch Oostenrijk (2k)
Sometimes the value is not in exceptional skill: the folks on this channel
barely make it in front of the camera. Their skill instead is being in the
**location** where I like to be. In my case the ski area of Westendorf, Austria.
They shoot short videos on the weather and ski conditions, new lifts being
build up, how it looks like in the summer. This idea does not scale well, but
for me it is valuable.

### Mediocre Amateur (17k)
This channel is so non-pretentious and self-deprecating. Basically a couple of
middle-aged guys that are out for a little adventure: multi day trail runs in
the summer and ski touring in the winter. The story telling is unassuming, but
will drag you along non the less. It is just executed that well. And to be
honest, this channel single handedly made me sign up for a day of ski touring
in december 2019. Powerful stuff.

### Cody Townsend (20k)
If you wondered “what if I take Mediocre Amateur and scale the ambition way the
heck up?”, then... you have [Cody’s channel](https://youtu.be/6HeGQvjYbfY).
It’s the same story telling; you’re coming along on some risky ascents, but now
for effectively all 50 (!) 15.000ft+ peaks in North America. Besides some
[pretty humorous content](https://youtu.be/rfY7cCLSbbc) Cody is busy achieving
his goal. Ascent every one of the 50 tallest peaks on the North American
continent. He’s half way through as I write this, [here’s the
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSj-6RsDycxnKiIFFm0BFYoLLV5Np3K49)
and [here is the introduction and motivation for the
series](https://youtu.be/lvZk_B6FwXc).

### Stomp it tutorials (151k)
Jens does a great job churning out ski tutorials with a thin veneer of [geeky
humor, testing a merino wool shirt for 11 days](https://youtu.be/Sh8BFytupwA).
Just like half the others on this list, just him, his passion, and someone with
a 5 year old camera. And because it is right up my alley, this is more
captivating that a national broadcast television series.

### Hedvig Wessel (5k)

### Burrfection (152k)
Chuck full of information, the tutorials on [how to sharpen a
knife](https://youtu.be/KB87xoFm46g) are excellently done. The visual esthetic
is very simple and the production values are great and I love some of the
scientific approach (how he measures the sharpness of the knife with an
Edge-On-Up. The [knife review videos](https://youtu.be/ZNYhi6QwmzE) are well
done but less interesting to me personally.
