YouTube is just plain impressive. Launched in 2005, fourteen years later 300
hours of video are uploaded every minute. It generates more than 4B$ of
revenues annually[^1]. There are over 1 billion video views on mobile devices
alone, every single day. This thing is an absolute beast. 

But as everyone with a kid would know, it is also a gigantic cesspool. Leave
your 5 year old for 3 minutes unattended behind YouTube and she will be
watching Ryans World or worse yet one of those candy unwrap videos, every
single time. The amount of—and please pardon my French—crap on YouTube is
astounding. The signal versus noise on that platform is through the floor, very
much unlike something like Wikipedia. On both of these you can loose hours and
hours by jumping from one to the other page or video. The difference is that on
Wikipedia sometimes you end up on a decent article thats just not so
interesting to you. On YouTube you end up on total garbage.

But because YouTube is so gigantic, there are absolute jewels of content to be
found in that pile. YouTube democratized the production, distribution and
viewing of these videos, lowering the barrier to entry enormously. This leads
to content that is razor focussed: take any niche topic and go super deep. In a
national TV broadcast situation how many channels are devoted to people
building a Scanning Electron Microscope from scratch? You pick the nation, the
answer is still going to zero. But on YouTube you will [find a non-zero
answer](https://youtu.be/VdjYVF4a6iU).

So the challenge then becomes one of discovery. Lots has been written about the
(in)famous YouTube algorithm—I kid, of course more videos have been produced
about that topic than written posts. I realized I curated a list of ±150
channels that I admire, the jewels in that massive heap of candy-unwrap-videos.
And I wanted to share some of those for discovery, hopefully someone finds
these useful. (I do realize the number of people liking this exact set of
videos is exactly one: me.)

The subscriber counts for each channel were taken November 2019.

## Watches
### Hodinkee (126k)
The one and only content side for watch collectors. It is not a small setup as
itemploys 88 people but some of the content is excellent. Here, for example, is
a video that [goes through all the different references for the OMEGA
Speedmaster](https://youtu.be/w8-DdurbLKw). Or here is their [Talking Watches
episode with Alton Brown](https://youtu.be/PvWiUYKgb6M). First time I saw these
I was star struck mashing up the Speedmaster and Alton.

### Watchfinder & Co (391k)
This channel is impressive because it showcases a massive mount of expertise on
display, but those delicious finger licking production values are through the
roof. Here is an example where a [Patek is being compared to a
Speedmaster](https://youtu.be/ZT9rvtlk_yc); those close ups and lighting are
fantastic. Similarly here is their [deep dive into
Chronographs](https://youtu.be/k1HhRPDmCgw).

## Video editing
### Aidin Robbins (126k)
It is beautiful to follow Aidin’s growth through his recording and editing of
movies. The work that he has published is fantastic. The best for me are his
“cinematic sequences” such as his [2018 video](https://youtu.be/b9GtkyN-S1M) or
his [Iceland video](https://youtu.be/WSLbCs64MLc). His tutorials are well put
together. His demeanor and authenticity are notable.  And he often follows up
later with a “how did I make that video” like [this one about the NYC
video](https://youtu.be/GaG9n_acKic).

### Andreas Hem (208k)
Andreas, in my mind, is similar as Aidin: shooting and editing skills are
through the roof. But where Aidin’s work is subtle, Andreas’ work shouts and
goes over the top in the most incredible ways. Here is [Andreas turning himself
into Spiderman](https://youtu.be/xc_uUUY0ngU) or his [100k subscriber
celebration video](https://youtu.be/FmaAlIAMe8I). If that turns out not to be
“over the top” enough for you, then see his [we raided Area 51
video](https://youtu.be/6hnHWDxYm2c).

### DSLR Video Shooter (415k)
Caleb Pike reviews gear for shooting video, including lighting, lenses, [camera
systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLDSa83hU-bIFIowvOfAe2h_C6akKcqRZ).
Straight to the point, honest reviews. This also includes super in-depth
reviews of the Sony and Panasonic cameras. His [color correction and grading
tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLDSa83hU-bKZeB0CCZyHcf3kbcMRKkuK)
are fantastic as well. Unlike some others that play it by feeling, Caleb works
it up from ground principles. He has done a lot of work on audio as well. And
then I have not even spoken about his b-roll!

### JayAreTV (45k)
Jay has done a fantastic job bringing Davinci Resolve knowledge to the
community. Ranging from a simple [Basic callout with
tracking](https://youtu.be/DjdYQCdmYdo) through [Glitchy
Goodness](https://youtu.be/p_H8_iNcRsM) all the way to [building an odometer
from the ground up](https://youtu.be/3jMkUlet4hE) in Davinci Fusion. Or this
example [of animating a trip across a
map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taz-Ucsj4vE): he does it from the ground
up and the results always look fantastic and professional!

### Peter McKinnon (4M)
Peter has build up a massive channel with over 4 million subscribers. Combines
talking about methods, the enthusiasm, a little gear reviews and a lot of
personality. Inspiring movies such as [The Bucket
Shot](https://youtu.be/r25IWquxe9s) or [The mountains won’t remember
me](https://youtu.be/2Z0lv6qlj0Q), or [this vlog about
B-roll](https://youtu.be/TXzLvYN-HSc) from a few years ago.

### Taran van Hemert (140k)
Taran works at the massive outfit Linus Tech Tips as an editor. As a geek with
a passion for editing he published some [monumental editing tutorials such as
this one](https://youtu.be/O6ERELse_QY). It apparently took 10 months to edit
this 4 hour beast. Similarly, but on just tad smaller scale, [this comparison
on upscaling algorithms for video](https://youtu.be/MVPrFU6_SEA). Or take [this
40 minute video documenting him building a
treehouse](https://youtu.be/I2G6S33w7As).

### Every Frame a Painting (1.6M)
Every Frame a Painting stopped publishing in 2016, but until that time it did a
fantastic job in dissecting the editing in various movies. For me personally
this almost singlehandedly triggered my interest in editing. If I had to single
out one upload it would be [How does an Editor Think and
Feel](https://youtu.be/3Q3eITC01Fg), but it would be just as easy to pick out
[Composing Movement](https://youtu.be/doaQC-S8de8), [David
Fincher](https://youtu.be/QPAloq5MCUA), [Mother](https://youtu.be/dUOdQxQkVt8)
or [Edgar Wright](https://youtu.be/3FOzD4Sfgag). Loved seeing what he did about
the [Marvel universe and ‘temporary music’](https://youtu.be/7vfqkvwW2fs) as
well. I find it beautiful that YouTube has provided this platform where someone
like this is able to go deep and share these insights. 

### This Guy Edits (268k)
After Every Frame a Painting stopped publishing I went on looking for someone
else dissecting editing, and that quickly became This Guy Edits. Analyzing the
editing in various movies, such as [The 7 Laws of Film
Editing](https://youtu.be/i9mGSDluh9g), [Whiplash’s Brilliant
Editing](https://youtu.be/3qYB1qLx4R8) or this one on [of a scene
analysis](https://youtu.be/T-1VnWU-z5s). He's building an entire community
around the world of editing, for example through Patreon you can watch him in
real time edit a Hollywood feature film.

### Film Riot (1.5M)
Film Riot is both a little more commercial and geared towards short films, but
it is still very interesting and very well produced. Here is [Matti Haapoja
going behind the scenes, for example](https://youtu.be/OGtdUBXVL6M). Going back
8 years ago ([example](https://youtu.be/rSo_bMFT5YI)), there is a huge store of
how to story tell, tutorials on [editing](https://youtu.be/9_KOfYrxcF4), [more
editing](https://youtu.be/3sCIiIca6Cc), how to
[film/shoot](https://youtu.be/GZztR8cS3kI), [tips and
tricks](https://youtu.be/91sbBfTIHkc), interact with talent as well as [short
movies](https://youtu.be/EHlxqe2HRRk) that they produced.

## Cycling
### DC Rainmaker (141k)
DC Rainmaker is sitting right on the intersection of good enough video
production quality, cycling, [smart trainers](https://youtu.be/R8Di25Rs4pg),
[power meters](https://youtu.be/Ou_PnOfKDkU), gear reviews and
[GoPro](https://youtu.be/nRMadmQsuY8)/[Drones](https://youtu.be/QQa7BvkXfgk).
Over the years he’s build up so much credibility in this particular niche that
I basically consider it the last word in these matters.

### The Vegan Cyclist (107k)
On the opposite end of the spectrum from DC Rainmaker is The Vegan Cyclist — no
gear reviews but mostly focused on first person perspective of cycling races,
[criteriums](https://youtu.be/SFq7yBrx2Gk) and [tips and
tricks](https://youtu.be/NiLp0UEon98). It’s beautiful to see the ebb and flow
of [success and failure](https://youtu.be/luU4pL8-Nd0), the perseverance and
pain it takes to compete.

## Skiing
### Deb Armstrong (8k)
If you are wondering about how much value someone can generate  in videos by
taking their absolute expertise (in this case a world class skier turned into
gifted coach) and combine it with someone with a camera: look no further than
Deb. Complete no nonsense coaching as well as no nonsense video’s: all straight
to the point. The passion for the kids and the sport flows right off your
screen. After a couple of these videos you are left wishing she is coaching
**your kids**.

### Fantastisch Oostenrijk (2k)
Sometimes the value is not in exceptional skill: the folks on this channel
barely make it in front of the camera. Their skill instead is being in the
**location** where I like to be. In my case the ski area of Westendorf, Austria.
They shoot short videos on the weather and ski conditions, new lifts being
build up, how it looks like in the summer. This idea does not scale well, but
for me it is valuable.

### Mediocre Amateur (17k)
This channel is so non-pretentious and self-deprecating. Basically a couple of
middle-aged guys that are out for a little adventure: multi day trail runs in
the summer and ski touring in the winter. The story telling is unassuming, but
will drag you along non the less. It is just executed that well. And to be
honest, this channel single handedly made me sign up for a day of ski touring
in december 2019. Powerful stuff.

### Cody Townsend (20k)
If you wondered “what if I take Mediocre Amateur and scale the ambition way the
heck up?”, then... you have [Cody’s channel](https://youtu.be/6HeGQvjYbfY).
It’s the same story telling; you’re coming along on some risky ascents, but now
for effectively all 50 (!) 15.000ft+ peaks in North America. Besides some
[pretty humorous content](https://youtu.be/rfY7cCLSbbc) Cody is busy achieving
his goal. Ascent every one of the 50 tallest peaks on the North American
continent. He’s half way through as I write this, [here’s the
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSj-6RsDycxnKiIFFm0BFYoLLV5Np3K49)
and [here is the introduction and motivation for the
series](https://youtu.be/lvZk_B6FwXc).

### Stomp it tutorials (151k)
Jens does a great job churning out ski tutorials with a thin veneer of [geeky
humor, testing a merino wool shirt for 11 days](https://youtu.be/Sh8BFytupwA).
Just like half the others on this list, just him, his passion, and someone with
a 5 year old camera. And because it is right up my alley, this is more
captivating that a national broadcast television series.


## Engineering
### Applied Science (584k)
This channel is crazy. He drills thousands of holes in steel to test out the
effects of [cryogenic hardening on drill
bits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAxi5YXTjEk&t=183s) or how film cameras
of old [managed to put the date on the film
negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezME4_xMMnk). But what completely
showcased the depths this person is willing to go is his series in which he
**constructs** a [Scanning Electron
Microscope](https://youtu.be/VdjYVF4a6iU)... 

### SmarterEveryDay (7.4M)
At over 7M subscribers Dustin obviously is not very niche anymore. But his
story is one that is uniquely enabled by a video platform and ever growing
audience. I think most of started off [with this video on chicken heads being
stabilized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dPlkFPowCc) and it snowballed from
there, all the way to [meeting the President of the United
states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpWQHFzrEqc) (#44 to be precise). The
common theme across most videos is to find something non-obvious and explain
that to the audience in simlpe and emperical ways. [What happens to your brain
if one switchea the steering controls on a
bicycle?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFzDaBzBlL0). [Flipping cats, landing
on their feet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtWbpyjJqrU). [Laminar
Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7Hyc3MRKno). [Popping over to NASA and
their Moonrock collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxZ_iPldGtI). [How
did the Saturn V steer?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI-JW2UIAG0&t=) Just
subscribe, already.

## Space
### Scott Manley (979k)
I have a deep respect for Scott: he holds down some Silicon Valley job, but in
the meantime he produces well researched videos twice per week on anything
space and rocket related. The amount of knowledge he displays for a
non-professional is truly inspiring. Simple camera setup, one man show, focus
on the content. Scott never disappoints: [video on a space
launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xluxhnui5RQ), hundreds of videos about
[Kerbal Space
Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_oMwlTDuiA&list=PLYu7z3I8tdEmjsTPxZMAsU8_d30ctM1Hm),
[how gravity assists work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16jr7WWGSxo) or
[what is most confusion about
orbits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5XPFjqPLik). Ever wondered if you can
throw a tennis ball from the ISS Space Station back to earth? Which direction
would you throw it? [Come and find
out!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5XPFjqPLik)

### Everyday Astronaut (470k)
_Bringing space down to earth for everyday people_. This is in the same space
as Scott Manley, but slightly different. Lots of good material: [Interviewing
Elon Musk on the Raptor engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbH1ZDImaI8),
[why SpaceX ditched light carbon fiber in favor of stainless
steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LogE40_wR9k), or this video that helped
me prep for an [actual rocket launch in
Florida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBLeg0CvHek&).

### Sean Carrol (51k)
Space, the universe is immensely interesting. Sean has this capability of
explaining and reasoning about things in clear and engaging ways. He is not so
much a YouTuber as others on the list here, even though he started a series
called Mindscape. His best material is from conferences posted elsewhere:
starting off with his Royal Institute [presentation on "Particle at the End of
the Universe"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwdY7Eqyguo), the [Big Picture
at Google Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x26a-ztpQs8) or [The Origin of
the Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFEeHC6UIdU).

## Photography
### Sean Tucker (308k)
Sean is just very, very impressive. Sean previously was a priest, and for
better or worse he moved on into photography. What he does take forward with
himself, is that he is super calm, composed, and reasons from a humanistic
standpoint. It is a sea of calm in an ocean of screaming to get a microsecond
of attention from The Algorithm. I think one of his best and impressive videos
is [this documentary about three of his
mentors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_c30pHg2Hs). However, basically 65+
of his 72 videos are absolutely killing it: [Making it as an
introvert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_5aoPUSudI), [The legacy of your
Photography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBCxcCEoC7Y), [Good Light
series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZgqnw_aWrw) or [Embrace the Darkness,
a lesson for Light and Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBAFTR2lScY). And
this is what makes Sean so fantastic: you come in for the photography but stay
for all the life lessons Sean has on offer.

"**How can I be substantial if I do not cast a shadow? I must have a dark side
also if I am to be whole.**" -- Carl Jung

### Nigel Danson (153k)
Nigel is a landscape photographer, and is sharing his best practices for free
online in beautiful videos. Nigels comes across to me as very authentic. Some
examples include [How to improve your Drone
photography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PntG8KEVjR8), [Printing your
photos will improve them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEGLis6nGhA) or
[photography passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1JC9NlJYos).

### Joe Allam (192k)
Joe lives (or travels regularly) to Japan, is into photography and video, and
shoots Fuji X100, checking all my boxes. This again is an example of something
so specific that it could not exist on major television but through the
democratization that YouTube enabled; here we are! Examples from Joe include
[Tokyo street photography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8kMRq1kUXc), [Tokyo
Train photography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4BcJRivFJY) or [Cinematic
travel by train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCu8NE9FE0c).


## Livestyle
### Becky and Chris (163k) 
### Iz Harris, Johnny Harris (114k, 149k)

## Food
### Binging with Babish

### James Hoffman (112k)
James embodies what the internet at large, and YouTube specifically, does best:
the overlap of decent to good production values, combined with a passion and
expertise (coffee in this case) that leads to fantastic content that otherwise
would not exist. Completely unrelated, James has this fantastic voice. I could
listen to him for hours reading the classifieds section. James produces videos
on a lot of aspects related to coffee: [coffee bars as a business](), how to's
on [the ultimate V60 technique](https://youtu.be/AI4ynXzkSQo), the [best french
press technique](https://youtu.be/st571DYYTR8), [do coffee
tasting](https://youtu.be/cSEgP4VNynQ), [best blade grinder
results](https://youtu.be/cSEgP4VNynQ), reviews on the [Niche Zero
Grinder](https://youtu.be/FzOY2tHyZ4w), [Decent DE+ Espresso
Machine](https://youtu.be/FzOY2tHyZ4w) or the [Sage Precision
Brewer](https://youtu.be/HfkdkZRv6Mc).  Could keep going! 

## Misc
### Mumbo Jumbo

### Burrfection (152k)
Chuck full of information, the tutorials on [how to sharpen a
knife](https://youtu.be/KB87xoFm46g) are excellently done. The visual esthetic
is very simple and the production values are great and I love some of the
scientific approach he uses. For example how he measures the sharpness of the
knife with an Edge-On-Up. The [knife review
videos](https://youtu.be/ZNYhi6QwmzE) are well done but less interesting to me,
personally.

### Vsauce
### Standupmaths
### Captain Disillusion
### Tom Scott
### CGP Grey
### Veritasium
### Welch Labs
Welch Labs' Imaginary Numbers are Real video series was the first time I realized what YouTube had done. The content on display in this channel would otherwise not have been made, and even if it had, it would not be available to me. This [scene here shows the combo of using pen and paper and computer graphics](https://youtu.be/T647CGsuOVU?t=101) to such impressive ends. But what completely blew me away is [the first 10 seconds of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hiWbdc8QEk) where they draw a graph on paper, record it with a camera, run it through some python code and project the resulting graph on the video **in real time**. Even if you do not understand the complex/imaginary maths, this is just so cool! (Or [fast forward to 5:40ish](https://youtu.be/0hiWbdc8QEk?t=349) and your mind will be blown **again**.)

### Marques Bownlee
* Some Magic thing or two (Snap Casters, AJ Sacher ...)

[here](https://merchdope.com/youtube-stats/). No idea if these are accurate.
The conclusion on the size of YouTube stays the same: absolutely ginormous.
