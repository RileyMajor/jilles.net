Ever seeing the [Dtrace introduction
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6chLw2aodYQ) done by Bryan Cantrill I
loved his presentation style. Bryan is obviously a very smart technologist and
overflowing with idea's (or at least, that is how he comes across to me).
Watching that Dtrace video, it looks like his mind wants to say all these
insightfull things, his ability to speak barely keeping up with the flow.

So over the years I kept track of his presentations, and luckily Bryan has
worked on some very inspirational software throughout the years as the CTO of
[Joyent.com](http://www.joyent.com). What astonishes me is that so few people
have seen either the work Joyent has done (SmartOS, SDC, Mantra, etc) or Bryans
presentations. Apropos of conversations I have with others in the field, I
usually end up sending them a link to one or two videos (whatever feels
relevant). This happened now so often that this post subjectively aggregates
the most important ones.

## Dtrace introduction
As mentioned, this was the first presentation I ever saw done by Bryan. In here
is presents his work at Sun developing
[Dtrace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace). Dtrace is a dynamic tracing
framework that is safe to use in a production environment. It also spans across
both Kernel and User space in your operating system (such as Solaris, SmartOS
or even Mac OS!). In the video Bryan comes across as a bit of a virtuoso and
even doing ad-hoc demo's that clearly have not been prepared but work out
fantastically.
