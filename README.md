Here's the source for my blog. At first this was based on Coffecomrade.com's weblog 
but since 2014 I have switched to Balzac (see footer of the site for links)


Features
--------

* Obviously completely based off of Jekyll (v2)
* Rake build system around it so compile other assets (SASS, etc) in a consistent manner
* Rake integrated with git such that nothing EVER will be pushed to PROD without that being both in git and pushed to github.com
* Integrated link checking (will spider the whole site on DEV and PROD builds so that you can not push internal links that result in 404's)
* Now also features the ability to host podcasts: a XML feed, individual episode pages
* Tidy integration so that all pages' source code look good and well formatted
