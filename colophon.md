Colophon
========
This is my weblog and my little corner on the internet. [See here for more
information about me]({{site.baseurl}}/about.html). I've build many big sites
in my professional career, so I figured a small weblog should be possible. To
be honest this is probably already incarnation number 4 ([see old
version]({{site.baseurl}}/perma/2006/03/05/welcome-to-v3-blog/index.html)) of
the site. Hope you enjoy.

General Setup
-------------
The first few years I ran my personally crafted blogging system, which was
great because I could experiment with it as a software developer. After my
spare time became too scarce I moved it all over to a Wordpress blog.
Maintaining that became too hard though: keeping up with all the security
patches alone is too much work.

So the current iteration of the site you are looking at is completely
statically generated. Here is the software I use:

* Jekyll for rendering the site and templates
* Git and [Github](https://github.com/ojilles) to maintain all the data
* Hosted by one.com
* I use VIM to author all the articles
* Rake to automate various tasks (ensuring everything is checked into Git,
  deploying the blog to production, etc)
* Disqus for the commenting system, where enabled
* Thanks to the completely backwards native ftp client on Mac OS X, I'm using
  NcFTP to deploy to production

[TODO]

Credits and Acknoledgments
--------------------------
Like most people that get started with Jekyll, they look at the Github
repositories out there and build off of one that comes closest to what they
want. I did the same thing and want to acknoledge the work [Bryan Matthew
Warren](http://coffeecomrade.com/) has done. 

Copyright and -lefts

You are allowed to take anything from this site with two exceptions:
