		<h2><a href="http://coffeecomrade.com/articles/tasting-notes-pachamama-peru.html">Tasting Notes - Pachamama - Santa Teresa, Peru</a></h2>
		<p>This review is difficult to write. Difficult not only because I have to be harsh, but also because I feel like I&#8217;ve failed. I attempt to find a redeeming or commendable quality in just about every brew I try.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t find anything to like about <a href='http://www.pachamama.coop/detail.cfm?id=3930[jsshaper]:'>Pachamama&#8217;s Peruvian offering</a>. It&#8217;s just bad coffee.</p>

<p>It lacks aroma. The mouthfeel is indistinguishable from tepid water. The acidity is off the chart. Its flavor is simple and singular; but unfortunately that flavor is dirt. I&#8217;m not exaggerating, it tastes like dirt. Or, more specifically, dirt-laden coffee bean skins (chaff).</p>

<p>My typical review process is to brew and drink several cups over a few days, making notes each time. When I sit down to write the review, I&#8217;ll brew up another cup and go over my previous notes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sitting here drinking my third cup of this monstrosity and my opinion hasn&#8217;t changed. The nuance that usually reveals itself after repeated tastings is completely absent. I hate this bean.</p>

<p>The things I do for you people.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://coffeecomrade.com/articles/tasting-notes-dynamite-roasting-sumatra-mandheling.html">Tasting Notes - Dynamite Roasting - Sumatra Mandheling</a></h2>
		<p><a href='http://www.dynamiteroasting.com/'>Dynamite Roasting</a> cooks up beans in Black Mountain, NC. The organic roaster offers a wide variety of both blends and single-origin roasts.</p>

<p><img src='http://coffeecomrade.com/photos/tasting_-dynamite_-sumatra-mandheling/tasting_-dynamite_-sumatra-mandheling_-beans.jpg' alt='Dynamite Roasting - Sumatra Mandheling - Beans' /></p>

<p>The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandailing'>Mandheling</a> beans are a medium roast that edge slightly toward dark. The aroma is deep and decidedly &#8220;brown&#8221; with strong punches of salt and earth. Yeah, &#8220;earth.&#8221; In a good way.</p>

<p><img src='http://coffeecomrade.com/photos/tasting_-dynamite_-sumatra-mandheling/tasting_-dynamite_-sumatra-mandheling_-grounds.jpg[jsshaper]:' alt='Dynamite Roasting - Sumatra Mandheling - Grounds' /></p>

<p>Nut flavor is pervasive, held up by subtle wood and oil textures. There&#8217;s a light hint of dark fruit–maybe cherry or pomegranate. The brew feels very thin and almost weightless. While this may seem like a reflection of poor body, the finished cup has an excellent build that allows the light weight to shine through.</p>

<p>I could drink this stuff all day. The aftertaste is just right; it doesn&#8217;t overstay its welcome. Surprisingly, the cup smells precisely as delicious as the grounds. This almost never happens. It&#8217;s an honest roast.</p>

<h3 id='verdict'>Verdict</h3>

<p>Dynamite Roasting&#8217;s <strong>Sumatra Mandheling</strong> is a real workhorse. It&#8217;s a general-purpose roast that works just as well in a drip pot as in espresso drinks. Several local joints keep this in their air pots. It&#8217;s good that way, but loses a lot of complexity. Brewed any other way, this roast is exceedingly excellent.</p>

<p>My review may not have reflected this, but I&#8217;m trying to show a bit of restraint. Dynamite&#8217;s Indonesian offering is my favorite coffee. No hyperbole. 5 Stars.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://coffeecomrade.com/articles/tasting-notes-equal-exchange-organic-midnight-sun.html">Tasting Notes - Equal Exchange's Organic Midnight Sun</a></h2>
		<p>I Grabbed this <a href='http://shop.equalexchange.com/ProductInfo.aspx?productid=10032'>dark roast from Equal Exchange</a> at the local co-op on sale.</p>

<p><img src='http://coffeecomrade.com/photos/tasting_-equal-exchange_-organic-midnight-sun/equal-exchange_-organic-midnight-sun_-beans.jpg' alt='Equal Exchange - Organic Midnight Sun - Beans' /></p>

<p>Look at how oily these suckers are! They&#8217;re practically dripping.</p>

<p>Brewed in my small Chemex, the finished product was decent, but lacking; so I moved on to the AeroPress. Using two tablespoons of beans–finely ground–produced a very tasty cup!</p>

<p><img src='http://coffeecomrade.com/photos/tasting_-equal-exchange_-organic-midnight-sun/equal-exchange_-organic-midnight-sun_-crema.jpg' alt='Equal Exchange - Organic Midnight Sun - Crema' /></p>

<p>The aroma is thick with syrup, almost malty. The flavor is quite rich with absolutely no notes of fruit and a very heavy, bold coffee flavor. Its taste is rather simple. It feels heavy in the mouth with very low acidity. The crema is creamy and rich with oil. As I often experience–quite enjoyably–with dark roasts there is a subtle coconut aftertaste mixed with dark chocolate.</p>

<p>Midnight Sun is drinkable despite its fairly modest complexity. It lingers on the tongue <em>slighty</em> too long and tastes exclusively of coffee. The flavor lacks nuance, as is common with the darkest roasts, but this is disappointing only if you&#8217;re expecting a diverse flavor profile. This roast won&#8217;t grab everyone, but those who enjoy their drink bold will find something to like.</p>

<h3 id='verdict'>Verdict</h3>

<p>Recommended <em>only</em> if you <em>really</em> like dark roasts. 2 Stars.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve always been lousy at introductions, so I&#8217;ll get straight to the point.</p>

<p>You see, coffee and I – we sort of have a &#8216;thing.&#8217; I confess. Well, it&#8217;s really more of a lusty infatuation. I figure if we&#8217;re going to keep spending this much time together, I should probably learn a thing or two about her. You know, so we have something to talk about <em>above</em> the sheets.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll use this space to collect tasting notes and make snarky comments on the generally snobby coffee community. I won&#8217;t, however, get into pedantic discussions over the precise pressure to pull a proper shot of espresso.</p>

<p>But I probably will keep up the alliteration.<span>jsshaper</span>: http://jsshaper.org &#8220;an extensible framework for JavaScript syntax tree shaping&#8221;</p>
