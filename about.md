This is the weblog of Jilles Oldenbeuving. I have build many big sites in my professional career, so I figured a small weblog should be possible. To be honest this is probably already incarnation number 4 ([see old version]({{site.baseurl}}/perma/2006/03/05/welcome-to-v3-blog/index.html)) of the site. Hope you enjoy.
