I've created a setup with my RSS reader that allows me to repost articles that I read onto this page. Generally, I repost items that I think are pretty interesting and are worthwhile to read, for someone with similar interest. Also, I will shamelessly plug my own posts if I see fit: you have been warned ;-) Anyway, enjoy. If you need to RSS feed that republishes this:  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Jilles_Shared_Stories">http://feeds.feedburner.com/Jilles_Shared_Stories</a>.
