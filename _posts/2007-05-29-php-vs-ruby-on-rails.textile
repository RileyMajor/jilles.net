Terry Chay over at "<a href="http://terrychay.com/blog/">The Woodwork</a>" has a length but nicely <a href="http://terrychay.com/blog/article/is-ruby-the-dog-and-php-the-dogfood.shtml">written blog post about a PHP vs Ruby on Rails discussion</a>. If you're interested in that kind of stuff, read the article: it has some juicy humor sprinkled into it as well; it's a bit flame bait too...

Favourite quote (quoting another quote):


bq.     â€œFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.â€
    â€”Mahatma Ghandi

OSCON 2005:

    â€œUnless youâ€™re Ruby.â€
    â€”Danny Oâ€™Brien, â€œOn Evilâ€

And:


bq. I canâ€™t speak for Alex, but what Iâ€™m saying is look at the top 100 websites on the internet: about 40% of them are written in PHP and 0% of them are written in Rails. (Yes, I can (and am) using this statistic to grind you Ruby fuckers into the dust.)
