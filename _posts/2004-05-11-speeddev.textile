Well, today Iâ€™ve had a long discussion with someone from <a href="http://www.jilles.net/wp-admin/http:/www.speedev.com/">SpeedDEV</a>. Iâ€™ve been in touch with them for a little while now. They make something that lets itself describe best (in my own words) as
bq. â€œAn Issue and Requirements tracking application with advanced functionality for process and project management with a very high level of automation and flexibility.â€
<p class="MsoNormal">The employees are very nice to me and very helpful. Two things surprise me about this company and its product:



<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">I have never seen a greater      difference between a companies own website and the product it has      developed. The product SpeeDEV is something that struck with me amazement      (such a good and thoroughly developed product!). Yet, if you look at their      company website it looks like it was developed by a bunch of high school      students.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">The product itself is by far      the most thoroughly developed product in the Issue/Requirements tracking market      Iâ€™ve seen till today. (Iâ€™ve seen a lot of these products already. Thatâ€™s      not to say that Iâ€™ve seen everything, but still says something about      SpeeDEV.) For example, the entire application is web based. They advert      with a process automation engine and an editor to go with that. Youâ€™d      expect some half-baked solution in <span class="caps">DHTML</span> that will      barely do what you want it to do. But not SpeeDEV, oh no! It comes with an      entire editor that would behave just like a desktop application (ala Visio      or the like) to define the process you want. Perfect!</li>
</ul>
In time to come Iâ€™ll report more often on SpeeDEV. One reason for that is that on the web there is almost nothing to be found about this product except on the company website (<a href="http://www.jilles.net/wp-admin/http:/www.google.com/search?as_q=speedev&num=10&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&as_occt=any&as_dt=e&as_sitesearch=speedev.com&safe=images">Google</a> turns up only 679 results for example). And thatâ€™s pretty exceptional for a product that is in its 4.x version series.
