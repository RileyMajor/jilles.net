I am currently reading [A storm of
swords](http://www.amazon.com/Storm-Swords-Song-Fire-Book/dp/055357342X) by
George R.R. Martin. That book is book #3 in a series called _A song of ice and
fire_. I was pointed to this series by some people on usenet. After reading
almost all the material written by J.R.R. Tolkien I wanted something else, but
similar.

The first book was a true page-turner. Once you got into the characters the
story was absolutely breath-taking. The second book, [A clash of
kings](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553579908/104-8640111-8926352?n=283155)
, introduced 3 dragons (oh yeah, it was **if possible** even more a
page-turner as book #1). While there are much more plots, sub-plots and other
interesting things going on in the series, the dragons capture my attention
more than anything else. It is like the history of G.R.R. Martins world
becomes alive again: dragons flying through the air! Ah well... I'll see what
[A storm of
swords](http://www.amazon.com/Storm-Swords-Song-Fire-Book/dp/055357342X)
brings me on this topic.

PS: Martin is different from Tolkien in at least two aspects:

* A song of ice and fire entails 3k+ pages where The lord of the rings entails
  only half of that. Now I know that _A song of ice and fire_ is not finished
  yet, and I also know that there is much more Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales
  and The Hobbit (Middle Earth's books contain 3k+ pages too).

* Another difference between Tolkien and Martin is that all important
  characters survive throughout the story in _The lord of the rings_, whereas
  in _A song of ice and fire_ main characters will die on you. That was
  something that shocked me, being used to Tolkien as I was. I think I like
  Martin's approach in this respect. But then again Martin started out on
  doing 7 book series, whereas Tolkien wrote 1 book (and the publisher turned
  it into 3, but thats another story).

PS 2: I'm trying not to read too much at once so that I won't rush through the
story... first time I'm regulating how much I read.
