Just ran across <a href="http://www.basilv.com">the site off Basil Vandegriend</a>, who wrote <a href="http://www.basilv.com/psd/blog/2006/understanding-project-schedules">an article back in May</a> about project management for software development projects. In that article he shows an <a href="http://www.basilv.com/psd/software-files/launchManagementDiamond.html">application that shows the relation between the four factors</a> that play a role in project management: time, resources, scope and quality with which you can visually show their relation.
