### About the recipe
[September 11, 2011](http://twitter.com/#!/ojilles/status/112888263747969024): 
the day I made this recipe for the first time. I remember it distinctly:
not always do recipes you try out for the first time work well. However,
this time it blew me away. People that know me know that I don't like
tomatoes but for some reason I had gotten it into my head to try this
recipe. And it came out so delicious! And this recipe only has a few
very basic ingredients most of which you will actually have in your
kitchen as you read this very webpage!

[Roberto Tucci](http://www.linkedin.com/in/robertotucci) said this about
the recipe: _"It looks absolutely perfect! Could have come from a real
restaurant!"_. If a real Italian says that, you can not go wrong.

#### Source / Credits
I read the recipe first on [Smitten
Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/2011/08/naked-tomato-sauce/) and was
intrigued by the simplicity and availability of all ingredients. Deb
Perelman apparently got it from someone who's working at
[Scarpetta](http://www.scottconant.com/restaurants/scarpetta/new-york), in
New York ([another
write-up](http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2009/10/making-scarpetta-tomato-basil-spaghetti-scott-conant-scarpetta-meatpacking-district-nyce.html)).
In any case, believe me when I say, you have got to try this!
