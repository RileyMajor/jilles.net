### About the recipe
[September 11, 2011](http://twitter.com/#!/ojilles/status/112888263747969024): 
the day I made this recipe for the first time. I remember it distinctly:
not always do recipes you try out for the first time work well. However,
this time it blew me away. People that know me know that I don't like
tomatoes but for some reason I had gotten it into my head to try this
recipe. And it came out so delicious! And this recipe only has a few
very basic ingredients most of which you will actually have in your
kitchen as you read this very webpage!

I love seeing pictures with my recipies, it gives me a nice visual
confirmation of the recipe (how to prepare, but also if I would like the
end result). So likewise, I have cooked this dish twice, practically
just to make the pictures. I've included plenty of them in this page, but
the full set is available on [Flickr here](http://!!!!!!!!!!).

[Roberto Tucci](http://www.linkedin.com/in/robertotucci) said this about
the recipe: _"It looks absolutely perfect! Could have come from a real
restaurant!"_. If a real Italian says that, you can not go wrong.

#### Source / Credits
I read the recipe first on [Smitten
Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/2011/08/naked-tomato-sauce/) and was
intrigued by the simplicity and availability of all ingredients. Deb
Perelman apparently got it from someone who's working at
[Scarpetta](http://www.scottconant.com/restaurants/scarpetta/new-york), in
New York ([another
write-up](http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2009/10/making-scarpetta-tomato-basil-spaghetti-scott-conant-scarpetta-meatpacking-district-nyce.html)).
In any case, believe me when I say, you have got to try this!

According to my Italian collegues, this dish is called _Spaghetti Pelati_ (Naked Tomatoes).

### Ingredients
These ingredients should serve 4 people.

* 1.3 kg plum tomatoes (3 pound)
* 3/4 teaspoon coarse salt
* 1 clove garlic (slice thinly, or through garlic press)
* Pinch of red pepper flakes, or some Cayenne powder
* Small handful basil leaves, most left whole, a few slivered for garnish
* 60ml olive oil (1/4 cup)
* 300 gram dried spaghetti (12 ounces or 3/4 pound)
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

Personally I would just plan to make this dish a few times, alternating
various things to get the hang out of it. For example, I never weighed
my tomatoes, but will vary the amount to see how it changes the dish.

### Procedure

#### 1. Get the tomatoes prepared

* Boil a large pan of water, large enough to fit the spaghetti later
* Cut a small X on the top/bottom of the tomatoes and boil them in the
water for 30 seconds or so. I found that less fleshy tomatoes take Â±15s
less
* Remove the tomatoes from the pan, then shock them under cold water
* Peel the tomatoes, then quarter them all while removing the seeds
  above a small strainer reserving the precious tomato juices for later
* If you want, you can process the tomataes quickly through a kitchen
  machine, or during the next step with a potato masher
* Take a saucepan that could hold the pasta later, turn heat to medium
  high and put in the tomatoes. Once a boil has been achieved, adjust
heating such that the tomatoes simmer
* Keep going for 35-45 minutes. Once sauce gets too dry, add the
  retained tomato juices in (or water if you run out)

I find that the longer the sauce simmers, the better the taste. Again,
something you can experiment with.

#### 2. Infuse the oil

#### 3. Boil the pasta

#### 4. Finish up!
