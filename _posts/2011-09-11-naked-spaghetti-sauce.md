### About the recipe
September 11, 2011: the day I made this recipe for the first time. I
remmember it distinctly: not always do recipes you try out for the first
time work well. However, this time it blew me away. People that know me
know that I don't like tomatoos but for some reason I had gotten it into
my head to try this recipe. But it came out so delicious!

I read the recipe first on [Smitten
Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/2011/08/naked-tomato-sauce/) and was
intrigued by the simplicity and availabilty of all ingredients. Deb
Perelman aparently got it from someone who's working at
[Scarpetta](http://www.scottconant.com/restaurants/scarpetta/new-york), in
New York ([another
write-up](http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2009/10/making-scarpetta-tomato-basil-spaghetti-scott-conant-scarpetta-meatpacking-district-nyce.html)). In any case, believe me when I say, you got to try this!
