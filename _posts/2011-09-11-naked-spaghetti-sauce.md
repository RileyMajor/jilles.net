### About the recipe
September 11, 2011: the day I made this recipe for the first time. I
remember it distinctly: not always do recipes you try out for the first
time work well. However, this time it blew me away. People that know me
know that I don't like tomatoes but for some reason I had gotten it into
my head to try this recipe. But it came out so delicious!

I read the recipe first on [Smitten
Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/2011/08/naked-tomato-sauce/) and was
intrigued by the simplicity and availability of all ingredients. Deb
Perelman apparently got it from someone who's working at
[Scarpetta](http://www.scottconant.com/restaurants/scarpetta/new-york), in
New York ([another
write-up](http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2009/10/making-scarpetta-tomato-basil-spaghetti-scott-conant-scarpetta-meatpacking-district-nyce.html)). In any case, believe me when I say, you got to try this!

### Ingredients

These ingredients should serve 4 people.

* 1.3kg plum tomatoes (3 pound)
* 3/4 teaspoon coarse salt
* 1 clove garlic (slice thinly, or through garlic press)
* Pinch of red pepper flakes, or some Cayenne powder
* Small handful basil leaves, most left whole, a few slivered for garnish
* 60ml olive oil (1/4 cup)
* 300 gram dried spaghetti (12 ounces or 3/4 pound)
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
