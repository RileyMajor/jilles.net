title: A new version of my blog
---

In various different forms my blog has survived from way back in
2003 till now. In the first couple of months, the blog would only
run on my own computer (I didn't have hosting back then). Now, I've
redone the block in Jekyll so that it is completely statically
generated (and pushed into GIT for convenience). 

I've only deleted two articles that basically were going absolutely nowhere.
Besides that I believe most of the content came across in tact. Let me know
if you see problems anywhere.

As for the comments, I have moved those over to Disqus. I may even remove them
completely as there are only a few of them. (If I do, I will leave a static
dump somewhere on this site for posterity.)

With that, I intent to write more again as well. It's been a long time since I
have written anything sensible on any topic. The last real articles were
written on the difference between Dutch and Danish culture ([Part
I]({{site.baseurl}}/perma/2008/12/20/denmark-compared-to-the-netherlands/) and
[Part
II]({{site.baseurl}}/perma/2009/04/11/denmark-versus-netherlands-part-ii/)).
Currently living in Italy for over a year now so that is a logical start. In
any case, we will see. For now, enjoy the new site and let me know if there is
anything wrong.
