title: A new version of my blog
---

In various different forms my blog has survived from way back in
2003 till now. In the first couple of months, the blog would only
run on my own computer (I didn't have hosting back then). Now, I've
redone the block in Jekyll so that it is completely statically
generated (and pushed into GIT for convenience). 

With that, I intent to write more again as well. It's been a long
time since I have written anything sensible on any topic. The last
real articles were written on the difference between Dutch and
Danish culture. Currently living in Italy for over a year now so
that is a logical start. In any case, we will see. For now, enjoy
the new site and let me know if there is anything wrong.
