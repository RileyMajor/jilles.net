<img align="left" title="Jilles weird image" id="image26" alt="Jilles weird image" src="http://www.jilles.net/wp-content/130360122_4652f35d4c_m.thumbnail.jpg" />While working on a draft article for this site I needed to collect some weird images of myself which could then be used in a collage because one of my collegues is going to leave. I myself don't want to pick that image, and was going to offer the creators of the collage the options. While not wanting to send them megabytes of images, I thought I might do it the Web 2.0 way and put them up on Flickr. Since someone is going to find them anyway, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jilles/sets/72057594109781558/">I might as well point you guys to it</a>.
