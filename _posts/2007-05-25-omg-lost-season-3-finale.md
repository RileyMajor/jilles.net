Just watched the Lost season finale and I must say I absolutely loved it. So
many variables, plots, and personalities changing around in the matter of an
hours worth of television. I am one of the Lost-fans that actually liked pretty
much all the episodes since the beginning -- but even those that didn't like
the last season too much were blasted away by this seasons' finale.

interview that I've spotted online with Damon Lindelof</a> is pretty
interesting if you'd like a few answers to the many questions being posed by
the finale.

Only 48 more episodes to go, since the show is slated to end in 2010!
