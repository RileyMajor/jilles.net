Inspired by the articles over at [Usesthis.com](http://www.usesthis.com) I
thought I would do my own write up in similar vain.

### Hardware

Over the last 8 years all of my hardware has moved into Apple land. When I was
still programming professionally I did so exclusively on Debian/Linux systems
and that is just what I am most comfortable with. The Mac offers that experience
with the notable exception of 'apt-get' package management. 

I am pretty happy with my setup this far. If you have any questions or would
love to contribute, fire away in the comments below!
