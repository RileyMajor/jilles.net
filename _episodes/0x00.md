```$ init```

Starting new things is hard. Computers "init", much easier! Here's the start of
a new podcast by someone who has never done this before. What can go wrong?

Over the last almost two decades of working for my employer in the Online
Classifieds space, I have come to the conlcusion that the most important part of
most everyone's job in Product and Technology are your collegues. Some of them
are absolutely remarkable human beings. It occured to me that this was not being
chronicled anywhere. And so that is the idea behind this podcast:

**This show is not about TODO but rather the people in it.**

Normal episodes of the {{site.podcast.title}} will consist of interviews with
people in the Product and Technology field working for the TODO (for now?). We
will explore their passions and achievements.

Want to nominate someone as a guest? Have questions you want to send in to the
show? Would like to help and collaborate? Like the show? Please contant me!

Here goes nothing,

Jilles
