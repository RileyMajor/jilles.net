<p>Want to keep up to date with this site? I have several options for you!</p>

<h3>RSS Feeds</h3>

<p>If you would like to subscribe to {{site.sitename}}, grab the RSS feed here! <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/jilles" title="{{site.site_name}} RSS Feed">RSS Feed</a></p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>
    If you like, I can send you an email with each new article as they appear on the site. This is not often and can be very convenient. Leave your email address below. (Obviously won't sell this, all run through the fabulous folks over at Mail Chimp) 

<form action="http://jilles.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=5e3b43c918d5e4004324092ee&amp;id=24088decb7" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="validate" target="_blank">
    Email address: <input type="text" value="" name="EMAIL" class="required email" id="mce-EMAIL"> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="btn">
</form>
</p>

<h3>Social Media</h3>
<p>You can also keep up to speed via social media. Be aware though that other messages will be posted there as well, so if you want just the articles, please use either RSS or Email.
